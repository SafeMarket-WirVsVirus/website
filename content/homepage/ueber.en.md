For most people, shopping is currently the only situation in which they have contact with many other people.
This is associated with a high risk of infection.
The current contact bans and curfews restrict access to the supermarket, so that queues can form in front of it.
In these queues there is also the risk of infection - especially if the minimum distance is not maintained.

This reduces customer satisfaction and increasingly overburdens the staff of various shops.
Particularly for older people, risk groups and people who are highly involved in their jobs, it is important to minimize queues so that everyone can shop more safely.
