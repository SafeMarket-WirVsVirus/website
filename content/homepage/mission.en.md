### #FLATTEN THE CURVE

With SafeMarket, customers can digitally reserve a period of time to shop at their local supermarket.
Once they arrive at the store, customers can show their QR code and enter the store immediately with a valid ticket.
Only a short time later the shopping is done - without long waiting times and unnecessary risk of infection in crowds.
