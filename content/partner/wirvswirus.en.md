Together with the German government, #WirVsVirus has created a digital participation process in the Corona crisis. The goal was to address the current challenges in a hackathon that brings together people with a wide range of talents and knowledge. For 48 hours, #WirVsVirus brought together 28,361 people who worked on over 1,500 solutions.  

The challenges addressed in the Hackathon came from the heart of society and from a wide range of sectors, from public life and health issues to support for individual professionals. Anyone with time, motivation and Internet access could take part. That's how #WirVsVirus created the biggest hackathon in the world.

But the hackathon was only the starting signal! With the #WirVsVirus program, an extensive support program was established, which makes it possible to test solutions quickly and implement them in a user-centered manner.
