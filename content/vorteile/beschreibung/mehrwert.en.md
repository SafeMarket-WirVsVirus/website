Everyone has to shop. As a result, many people meet in front of your store, queues form and there is a high risk of infection.

With a reservation via SafeMarket, the waiting time is eliminated. This means: higher customer satisfaction, reduced risk of infection and better planning for your customers.

In addition to the app for people with a digital affinity, SafeMarket also offers a planned telephone service to support your older customers.
Voluntary resources are limited.
