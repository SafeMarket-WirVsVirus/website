## About us

During the #WirvsVirus Hackathon our team developed a first prototype, which consisted of the following components:
- a Flutter App for the customer to book entry times
- a Vue.js application for the shopkeeper and doorman to configure the shop and check the entry times
- a backend in C# to bring the first two components together

The goal for the Hackathon was to implement the prototype as quickly as possible.
This changed immediately afterwards, because for a successful implementation additional factors have to be considered.
Due to our high motivation and willingness to innovate, we joined forces with other teams.
This enabled us to join the "Solution Enabler" program, which is supported by the German government.
